# Instructions for starting the build gulp
1. First step. If you need to initialize the nmp, you need to go to the "markup" directory and enter the command in the terminal "npm i".
2. Second step. If you need to run a quick build, then you must, while in the "markup" folder in the terminal, run the command "gulp".
3. For a complete build, everything is the same as in the second step, but the command in the terminal "gulp build".
